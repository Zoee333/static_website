        <h2>The Beginning: Traditional Art</h2>
        <p>
          Art has always been a passion of mine—a way to express creativity,
          unwind, and bring ideas to life. What started as simple sketches on
          paper has evolved over the years into a deeper exploration of
          digital art. Like many artists, my journey began with pencil and
          paper. I spent countless hours sketching, shading, and experimenting
          with different techniques. Traditional art taught me patience,
          precision, and the importance of fundamentals like perspective,
          anatomy, and lighting. There’s something irreplaceable about the
          tactile feel of graphite on paper or the blend of watercolors.

        <h2>The Transition to Digital Art</h2>
        <p>
          A few years ago, I decided to explore digital art. At first, the
          transition was challenging—getting used to a graphics tablet,
          learning new software, and adapting to a screen-based workflow
          took time. But the possibilities were endless:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Undo button (a lifesaver!)</li>
          <li>Layers for non-destructive editing</li>
          <li>Endless brushes and textures</li>
          <li>Easy color adjustments</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Programs like Procreate, IbisPaintX, and Clip Studio Paint became
          my new canvas. While I still love traditional art, digital tools
          opened up a world of efficiency and experimentation.

        <h2>My Digital Process</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most rewarding aspects of digital art is seeing a piece
          come together in stages. Below is a breakdown of my process for
          one of my recent works:
        </p>
        <h3>1. Sketching</h3>
        <p>
          I start with rough, loose lines to define the composition. Digital
          sketching allows for quick adjustments—no need to erase endlessly!
        </p>
        <h3>2. Line Art</h3>
        <p>
          Once the sketch feels right, I refine the lines, often using a
          clean ink brush. Some artists skip this step for a more painterly
          style, but I enjoy crisp outlines.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Base Colours and Flatting</h3>
        <p>
          Next, I block in flat colors on separate layers. This step is like
          a coloring book—simple but crucial for establishing the palette.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Shading and Lighting</h3>
        <p>
          Here’s where the piece starts to feel alive. I use layer modes like
          Multiply for shadows and Overlay for highlights to add depth.
        </p>
        <h3>5. Details &amp; Finishing Touches</h3>
        <p>
          Finally, I add textures, adjust colors, and polish small details.
          Sometimes, I revisit older steps to tweak proportions or lighting.
        </p>

        <p>
          Art is a journey, not a destination. Whether you prefer pencils,
          paints, or pixels, the most important thing is to enjoy the
          process. If you’re thinking of trying digital art, don’t be
          intimidated—every artist starts somewhere, and mistakes are just
          part of the learning curve.
